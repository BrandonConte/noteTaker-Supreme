In this repository, you will find an application that will allow you to create, store, and delete notes with a very easy to use interface. 
(Currently not functioning as intended, will be continuing to fix this during the coming weeks as I progress through my classwork.)

## <img id="installing" src="./public/assets/images/installing.png" style="height: 40px">

Once you have cloned the repo down from GitHub, you will want to run `npm install` in the command line to install all of the Node Modules needed to run the application.

## <img id="usage" src="./public/assets/images/usage.png" style="height: 40px">

In order to run this program locally you will need to:

1. Clone this repository to receive all the files.
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal to download all the needed dependencies (makes sure you are in the correct file directory).
3. Run `npm start` in the terminal to start a live server locally.
4. Open your browser and connect to 'http://localhost:3001/' in the address bar.
5. Click on the "Get Started" button to arrive at the note-taking interface.
